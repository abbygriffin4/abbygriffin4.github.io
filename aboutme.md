### A little about me

My name is Abigail Griffin and I am a senior at Middlebury College studying Neuroscience and Sociology. On campus, I work as a Research Assistant in a Neuroendocrinology lab, as a barista at Crossroads Cafe, and am a board member for Middlebury College Access Mentors.
When I'm not in class, I love spending my time running or biking and listening to music (specifically SZA, Florence + the Machine, and Spacey Jane). Check out my Spotify [here.](https://open.spotify.com/user/abigail.griffin-us?si=15e2fc5ce7b84657)

I'm creating this webpage as a part of my final project for *Reproducible Biology in R*, a J-term course taught by Professor Ash. This month, we have spent time learning the basics of reproducible coding in R and RStudio, answering scientific questions using statistics, creating publication-quality figures, and learning the skills that enabled us to work on cool projects like this one!
