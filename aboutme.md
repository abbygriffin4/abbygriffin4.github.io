### A little about me
My name is Abigail Griffin and I am a senior at Middlebury College studying Neuroscience and Sociology. On campus, I work as a Research Assistant in a Neuroendocrinology lab, as a barista at Crossroads Cafe, and am a board member for Middlebury College Access Mentors.
When I'm not in class, I love spending my time running or biking and listening to music (specifically SZA, Florence + the Machine, and Spacey Jane).
